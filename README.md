##  Executive Summary
This project aims to bridge the gap between clinical data and predictive insights. Using the **UCI Heart Disease dataset**, I built an end-to-end pipeline that not only predicts heart disease risk (Accuracy: ~85%) but also visualizes the underlying medical factors.

Unlike standard black-box models, this project focuses on **Interpretability**—explaining *why* a patient is at risk.

##  Key Insights (Visualized)
- **Cholesterol & Age:** Analysis confirms a positive correlation between age and cholesterol levels in high-risk patients.
- **Feature Importance:** The Random Forest model identified `thal` (Thalassemia) and `cp` (Chest Pain Type) as the strongest predictors of heart disease.

##  Technical Stack
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy (ETL pipelines)
- **Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib (Statistical plotting)
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest Classifier)

##  How to Run
